# This is the full Python implementation of Plum.

**cite: https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-018-0328-7**

## requirements:
- Python3
- Numpy
- Scipy
- matplotlib
- pyTwalk (see: visit: https://www.cimat.mx/~jac/twalk/ for package and installing instructions)
- sklearn (this is use to estimate the number of samples to be used as supported 210Pb no needed if using 226Ra or provide the core file with this value)

## setting folders
This code can be used as a Python module by putting the file in the core directory. I recommend to create a PyPlum folder in your ~/Documents folder (this is the default folder).

File PyPlum.py should be place in the folder where Cores and Calibration curves are located and python working directory has to be this same folder.

## Running instructions:

To load the package use:
import PyPlum
